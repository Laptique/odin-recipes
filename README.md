#### In this website I will attempt to create a very simple website about a certain recipes from "allrecipes.com"
#### The Tags I used for this, were:

```
- <br>: for more space in-between paragraphs
- <p>: for text paragraphs
- <h1-4>: for headers
- <a>: for links (+ attributes such as "width" and "height" to manipulate the images' size accordingly)
- <small>: for making the description underneath each recipe image small 
- <ul>: for unsorted lists (recipe ingredients)
- <ol>: for sorted lists (recipe steps)
```
